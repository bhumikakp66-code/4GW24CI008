---------DAY 1-------------
#->preprosesor
.h->only function
.c->gives defination or implementation
<>->we can replace with "" search it in entire path
& -> when the value is boolean , Long And (&&)
  -> numeric values, bitwise and (&)
  -> unary  
    
---------DAY 2-------------------
SRP 
cohersion and coupling
Data Structure 
array as an DS where it is easy to use and implement
Need of invention of
eg:
float a[12]
&a--address of the array
a--address of the 1st element
*a--value of 1st element
-> EVERY ADDRESS HAS A PROPERTY "SIZE OF THE DT PROPERTY"
-> size of the pointer is always 4byte in windows(depends on os) on mac and linux(8 byte)
a[0]=value 1.0 =address 1401
a[o]=1401
a[1]=1405
Q:address of first value of a[1]
1402
Q:address of a[1]
1405
a[1]=*(a+1)==value at (1401+1)=v at(1405)=2.0
a[0]=*(a+0) =*a =v at (1401)=1.0 ((a+0) 0 means jump to no element)
--TYPES OF POINTERS--
NULL POINTER-> pointer which is not pointing to any location in memory
WILD POINTER: An unintialized pointer which has some junk address.
CONSTANT POINTER: A pointer which pointes always to the same variable.
POINTER TO A CONSTANT:a pointer that can point to some other variable, but it cannot modify the value of the constant pointer to a constant
CONSTANT POINTER TO A CONSTANT:
---ARRAY---
1D ARRAY
&a--address of the array
a--address of the 1st element
*a--value of 1st element
2D ARRAY
&a--address of 2d array
a--address of the 1st 1D ARRAY
*a--address  of 1st element in 1st row
**a value of 1st element of 1st row in the 2D array
